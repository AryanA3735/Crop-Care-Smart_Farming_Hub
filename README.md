# CropCare-Smart-Farming-Hub
Fertilizer management poses challenge for farmers and they need guidance for it's utilization.
Since rainfall plays important role in nutrient loss, humility and temperature also plays vital role.
This project addresses the need for nutrient management by employing an advanced version of the random forest algorithm. It leverages time-series data to predict the precise nutrient requirements for various crops, considering rainfall patterns and crop fertility.
The proposed method is a valuable tool for enhancing soil fertility. It provides tailored nutrient recommendations that optimize conditions for crop growth while minimizing the risk of leaching and runoff, ultimately supporting sustainable agriculture.
